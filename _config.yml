  Hi there, my name is Nikos. I'm a bioinformatician, studying how the human genome folds in 3D and how mutations alter it to promote tumor growth.
  I got my bachelors degree in Computer Science at the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en) and later moved into bioinformatics where I acquired a master's degree and a PhD by the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).

  As you have probably guessed, I spend most of my working hours behind a screen. I enjoy coding, whether it is to ask questions on data, troubleshoot, or create pipelines. These days, I write most of my code in bash and R.

  Sometimes I write R packages and [Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), like a chart to represent multiple observations ([sinaplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sinaplot/vignettes/SinaPlot.html), [geom_sina](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_sina.html)) or a webserver to browse recurrent genomic structural variants across multiple tumor types ([SVscape](http://13.48.6.180:3838/svscape/)).
